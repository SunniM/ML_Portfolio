# ML-Portfolio
 Portfolio containing projects and assignments from CS 4375 - Introduction to Machine Learning
 
## Summary
Throughout this course, I have been given the opportunity to apply  what I habe learned in class, which is not often the case. Aside from the various machine learning models that I have learned, taking this class allowed me to develop stronger communication and collaboration skills. It also enabled me to improve my time management and analytical skills. This course has inspired me to use what I have learned to create a personal project which is a song recommender using the Spotify API. The repo can be found [here]()

## Component 0 - Getting Started  
> [Machine Learning Overview](component_0/ml_overview.pdf) - An introduction into machine learning and its basic principles

## Component 1 - Data Exploration in C++
> [Code](component_1/data_exploration.cpp) and [Documentation](component_1/data_exploration.pdf) - A simple program which analyze Boston housing data and outputs basic averages.

## Component 2 - Linear Models
> [Linear Regression](component_2/regression.pdf) - This notebook analyzes the fuel consumption and emissions of Canadian retail vehicles from 2000-2022.  

> [Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes](component_2/classification.pdf) - This note book analyzes the credit card payment data of people in Taiwan in 2005 to determine if they would would default on their credit card payments.

## Component 3 - Linear Models from Scratch in C++
> [Logistic Regression](component_3/program_1.cpp) - Source code for a Logistic Regression model using sex as a single predictor to determine survivorship.  

> [Naïve Bayes](component_3/program_2.cpp) - Source code for a Naïve Bayes model using age, sex, and passenger class as predictors to determine survivorship.  

> [Report](component_3/report.pdf) - Contains a write ups and output of each model. Distinguishes between **Generative** and **Discriminative** Models. Addresses the need for **Reproducible Research** in Machine Learning

## Component 4 - Similarity and Ensemble Methods Collaboration
The following notebooks analyze housing data of Perth, Australia
> [Regresssion](component_4/part_1.pdf) - Sunni Magan 

> [Classification](component_4/part_2.pdf) - Ruben Mathew  

> [Clustering](component_4/part_3.pdf) - Jaechul Kim  

> [Dimensionality Reduction](component_4/part_4.pdf) - John Lawler

> [Report](component_4/part_5.pdf) - Micah Katz

## Component 5 - Machine Learning with sklearn
This notbooks explores the different machine learning models and how they are implemented in the Python sklearn library.
> [Notebook](component_5/ml_with_sklearn.pdf) - PDF notebook

## Component 6 - Image Classification Deep Learning
This notebooks uses Tensorflow Keras to explore different deep learning architectures to classify siz different types of garbage (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash).
