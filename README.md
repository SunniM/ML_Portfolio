# CS4375-Portfolio
 Portfolio containing projects and assignments from CS 4375 - Introduction to Machine Learning

## Component 0 - Getting Started  
> [Machine Learning Overview](component_0/ml_overview.pdf) - An introduction into machine learning and its basic principles

## Component 1 - Data Exploration in C++
> [Code](component_1/data_exploration.cpp) and [Documentation](component_1/data_exploration.pdf) - A simple program which analyze Boston housing data and outputs basic averages.

## Component 2 - Linear Models
> [Linear Regression](component_2/regression.pdf) - This notebook analyzes the fuel consumption and emissions of Canadian retail vehicles from 2000-2022.  

> [Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes](component_2/classification.pdf) - This note book analyzes the credit card payment data of people in Taiwan in 2005 to determine if they would would default on their credit card payments.

## Component 3 - Linear Models from Scratch in C++
> [Logistic Regression](component_3/program_1.cpp) - Source code for a Logistic Regression model using sex as a single predictor to determine survivorship.  

> [Naïve Bayes](component_3/program_2.cpp) - Source code for a Naïve Bayes model using age, sex, and passenger class as predictors to determine survivorship.  

> [Report](component_3/report.pdf) - Contains a write ups and output of each model. Distinguishes between **Generative** and **Discriminative** Models. Addresses the need for **Reproducible Research** in Machine Learning

## Compontent 4 - Similarity and Ensemble Methods Collaboration
